<title>U.S. Patent For 3D Movement Data Goes To Red Light Holland Subsidiary, More AI Innovation Ahead</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Canadian mushrooms producer <strong>Red Light Holland&rsquo;s</strong> (OTCQB:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TRUFF#OTCQB">TRUFF</a>) wholly-owned tech subsidiary <strong>Radix Motion</strong> received a U.S. patent grant for the <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/22/12/29995855/psychedelic-therapy-boosted-by-3d-movement-data-this-company-is-aiming-to-patent-the-combination">use of human movement data</a> in psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT).</p>

<p>Attained through the USPTO&rsquo;s Patent Prosecution Highway (PTT) program&nbsp;with an issuing date of&nbsp;Nov. 7, Radix Motion&#39;s claims include using such data as a tool to promote positive experiences, to prevent negative experiences, to predict and personalize individual patient experiences, and to evaluate the therapy&rsquo;s efficacy.</p>

<p>The Silicon Valley-based company aims to file a continuation application to keep the application family open in order to seek additional allowed claims and new patents. This includes using the technology in real-time analysis to identify the position and body movement of a psychedelic facilitator or therapist to detect potential violations and consequently activate real-time alerts and safety measures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Importantly, Radix Motion asserts that its technology does not require sending or storing any video information, and &ldquo;helps to protect patient privacy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>CEO Sarah Hashkes</strong> says that as medical and wellness access to PAT grows, so does the need for technology potentially helping with data-driven decisions and real-time protection of patients and clients.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Human movement data in combination with AI is also an untapped area, which we believe should be included, for clinical research and new psychedelic compound development,&quot; Hashkes added.</p>

<p><strong>Patent attorney</strong> and Red Light Holland&rsquo;s senior advisor <strong>Graham Pechenik</strong> said the team moved through patent prosecution &ldquo;in record time,&rdquo; partly thanks to the received so-called first action allowance, and showing the technology&rsquo;s &ldquo;real uniqueness.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>RLH&rsquo;s CEO and director Todd Shapiro</strong> echoed the sentiment.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud that our embodied technology can help establish responsible best practices around psychedelics and contribute to positive change in the emerging psychedelic ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shapiro says the patent is an important milestone, further viewing its potential licensing or sale as another revenue stream for Red Light Holland.</p>

<p>Through its focus on building immersive and embodied technology for health and wellness, Radix Motion&rsquo;s other products include Meu, an AR/VR interactive hologram messenger,&nbsp;iMicroapp, a microdosing app also measuring poses&nbsp;and Wisdom VR, an interactive education on psychedelics.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>IGC Pharma, Inc</strong>. (NYSE:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/IGC#NYSE">IGC</a>) <strong>has been granted European Patent No. 3193862 by the European Patent Office </strong>for its innovative &quot;Cannabinoid Composition and Method for Treating Pain.&quot;</p>

<p>The newly granted patent introduces a pioneering method for treating pain in humans.</p>

<h3>How It Works</h3>

<p>Utilizing a cream base infused with a unique blend of cannabinoids, including<strong> </strong>tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) as well as&nbsp;other compounds, the cream or gel is designed for transdermal absorption.</p>

<p>It interacts harmoniously with the peripheral nervous and immune systems, effectively relieving pain without psychotropic or adverse side effects.</p>

<p>Recent consumer trends indicate a profound demand for safe and effective pain relief, and IGC Pharma is seeking to advance pain relief therapies, said<strong> Ram Mukunda, </strong>the company&#39;s CEO.</p>

<p>&quot;We aspire to redefine the standard for pain management, providing healthier alternatives to traditional medications,&quot; Makunda continued.</p>

Of Michigan Study Confirms</a></em></p>

<h3>Alternative Solution For Pain Management</h3>

<p>In America alone, over 56 million individuals grapple with debilitating arthritis, while 10 to&nbsp;30% of total joint arthroplasty patients endure persistent pain. Health economists estimated the annual cost of pain management in the U.S.&nbsp;ranged&nbsp;from $560 billion to $635 billion in 2012, the company said, citing the Journal of Pain&#39;s data.</p>

<p>&quot;Our portfolio now boasts an impressive 35 patent filings in various countries, including the U.S. and Canada,&quot; Makunda said. &quot;I believe that our innovative approach to pain relief has the potential to disrupt the industry, providing investors with a unique chance to be part of a transformative journey. With a substantial addressable market and a strong intellectual property portfolio, we are well-positioned for growth.&quot;</p>

<title>Court Slaps Trump With $5,000 Penalty Over Disparaging Website Post</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>On Friday, a judge handed down a $5,000 fine to former President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> over a derogatory post about a court staffer that remained on the website of his campaign for several weeks. The fine comes as part of Trump&#39;s ongoing civil <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/10/35325129/court-employee-gets-arrested-for-disrupting-donald-trumps-new-york-civil-fraud-trial-i-am-just-here">fraud trial in New York.</a></p>

<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: Judge <strong>Arthur Engoron</strong> slapped the fine on Trump for not promptly removing a disparaging post about a court staffer from his campaign website, despite being ordered to do so, the&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-letitia-james-fraud-contempt-new-york-ce593e3ee07d95bb6ec7e2de23f47dc9">Associated Press</a>&nbsp;reported.</p>

<p>The judge chose not to hold Trump in contempt for now but reserved the right to reconsider, including the possibility of jail time, if further violations occur.</p>

<p><em>See Also: <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/10/35327150/trumps-niece-says-ex-president-should-trademark-the-word-loser-as-jim-jordan-fails-to-clinch-house-s?itm_source=parsely-api" target="_blank">Trump&#39;s Niece Says Ex-President Should Trademark The Word &#39;Loser&#39; As Jim Jordan Fails To Clinch House Spe</a></em></p>

<p><strong>Christopher Kise</strong>, Trump&#39;s lawyer, attributed the failure to erase the post to an unintentional oversight by Trump&#39;s sizable campaign team. The post was finally removed late Thursday after Engoron brought it to the attention of Trump&#39;s legal team, according to the AP.</p>

<p>The judge stressed that Trump is ultimately accountable for his campaign&#39;s actions, even if the failure to remove the post was unintentional. He gave Trump 10 days to settle the $5,000 penalty.</p>

<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The fine comes after the former president was issued a gag order by Engoron earlier in the trial.&nbsp;The gag order was in response to <a href="http://www.benzinga.com/news/23/10/35076883/trump-hit-with-gag-order-in-civil-fraud-trial-judge-says-ex-presidents-remarks-about-his-staff-unacc">Trump&#39;s social media criticisms</a> of the judge&rsquo;s chief law clerk. The judge deemed such remarks unacceptable and warned of serious sanctions for any breaches of the order, potentially including fines or contempt of court charges.</p>

<h1>How Are Analyst Ratings Determined?</h1>
<p>Analysts are specialists within banking and financial systems that typically report for specific stocks or within defined sectors. These people research company financial statements, sit in conference calls and meetings, and speak with relevant insiders to determine what are known as analyst ratings for stocks. Typically, analysts will rate each stock once a quarter. </p>
<p>Some analysts publish their predictions for metrics such as growth estimates, earnings, and revenue to provide additional guidance with their ratings. When using analyst ratings, it is important to keep in mind that stock and sector analysts are also human and are only offering their opinions to investors.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>In the current market session, <strong>Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/VRTX#NASDAQ">VRTX</a>)</strong> stock price is at $361.86, after a <strong>0.81%</strong> decrease. However, over the past month, the company's stock went up by <strong>3.53%</strong>, and in the past year, by <strong>16.54%</strong>. Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is overvalued, even if the company is not performing up to par in the current session. </p>
<p><p><img src="https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1697834735_0.png" alt="Past Year Chart" /></p></p>
<h3>Evaluating Vertex Pharmaceuticals P/E in Comparison to Its Peers</h3>
<p>The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E could indicate that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future or it could mean that the company is undervalued. </p>
<p>Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the <strong>37.07</strong> in the Biotechnology industry, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. has a lower P/E ratio of <strong>28.19</strong>. Shareholders might be inclined to think that  the stock might perform worse than it's industry peers. It's also possible that the stock is undervalued. </p>
<p><p><img src="https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1697834735_1.png" alt="Guage" /></p></p>
<p>In conclusion, the price-to-earnings ratio is a useful metric for analyzing a company's market performance, but it has its limitations. While a lower P/E can indicate that a company is undervalued, it can also suggest that shareholders do not expect future growth. Additionally, the P/E ratio should not be used in isolation, as other factors such as industry trends and business cycles can also impact a company's stock price. Therefore, investors should use the P/E ratio in conjunction with other financial metrics and qualitative analysis to make informed investment decisions. </p>]]></description>

<title>Tesla Stock Down After Q3 Earnings, Gene Munster Says 'Dark Chapter' For EV Company Could Last A Year</title>
<link>https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/23/10/35357591/tesla-stock-down-after-q3-earnings-gene-munster-says-dark-chapter-for-ev-company-co</link>

<pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 16:36:27 -0400</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Investors in electric vehicle company <strong>Tesla Inc </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ">TSLA</a>) saw shares drop on the week after the company <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/23/10/35318136/tesla-q3-earnings-highlights-revenue-miss-eps-miss-cybertruck-launch-set-for-november-and-more">reported third-quarter financial results </a>that came in below estimates from analysts.</p>

<p>While there are plenty of potential catalysts for Tesla in the future such as&nbsp;FSD, robotaxis, Taxi Bot, more vehicles, and the launch of the Cybertruck, <strong>one Tesla investor sees more short-term pain ahead.</strong></p>

<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Analysts have been <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/23/10/35332610/tesla-sized-up-by-9-analysts-after-q3-earnings-mini-disaster-conference-call-first-">mixed on Tesla </a>going forward after the company reported third-quarter financial results. A conference call that saw an overall cautious tone from the company and CEO Elon Musk was also among the concerns from analysts and investors.</p>

<p>With short-term concerns, Tesla could have a dark chapter that lasts a year, according to <strong>Deepwater Asset Manager</strong> co-founder and Managing Partner<strong> Gene Munster.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;Tesla&rsquo;s September results and outlook commentary revealed a double whammy of pressures on the business, prolonged margin pressure, and dampened demand outlook,&rdquo; Munster <a href="https://deepwatermgmt.com/teslas-dark-chapter-will-likely-last-a-year-then-things-brighten/">said</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Munster said the next year could be the most difficult period of time for Tesla since the ramp-up of the Tesla Model 3 in 2019.</p>

<p>One key item from the quarterly report was gross margins, which were significantly lower than many were expecting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gross margins are central to the Tesla investment case because the metric best gauges whether the company is on track to be valued as a tech company or just another automaker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Munster said the miss by Tesla on gross margins was worse than anticipated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even worse, the potential for margin improvement over the next year was essentially taken off the table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another item that may have spooked investors was comments from Musk on Tesla&rsquo;s goal of average annual unit growth of 50%.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not possible to have a compound growth rate of 50% forever or you will exceed the mass of the known universe,&rdquo; Musk said.</p>

<p><em>Related Link:<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/23/10/35336037/trading-strategies-for-tesla-stock-post-q3-earnings-miss"> Trading Strategies For Tesla Stock Post Q3 Earnings Miss&nbsp;</a></em></p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Next:</strong> One of the biggest items shared during the third quarter results was the fact that the highly anticipated <strong>Cybertruck will begin deliveries in November for Tesla, later revealed to be a Nov. 30 delivery event.</strong></p>

<p>Musk was cautious about the outlook of the ramp-up for the Cybertruck, but investors and analysts remain bullish on the potential of the catalyst that has been years in the making.</p>

<p>Tesla confirmed that pre-orders for the Cybertruck are over one million, which is a huge number, but could be lower than <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/08/33995360/how-many-cybertruck-reservations-are-there-tesla-fans-predict-a-staggering-total-ahead-of-launch">third-party estimates</a>, which are closer to two million.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Given Cybertruck will take orders away from the F Series, I believe Cybertruck will be the best-selling truck in the U.S. in 2025 or 2026.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The F-Series from <strong>Ford Motor Co</strong>&nbsp;(NYSE:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/F#NYSE">F</a>) is currently the bestselling truck in the U.S. annually and<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/01/30337806/tesla-had-a-top-10-selling-vehicle-in-the-us-for-2022-what-it-means-and-whats-next-for-2023"> has been for decades.</a> Munster saw around 500,000 to 750,000 of the Cybertruck pre-orders materializing and Tesla&rsquo;s ramp up getting to around 500,000 Cybertrucks delivered annually and the vehicle also taking market share away from the popular Ford truck.</p>

<p>Another positive takeaway from Munster is the tough place that traditional automakers and Tesla rivals find themselves in today.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tesla has the upper hand when it comes to building a car company with an electric focus from the ground up. Today, traditional car companies are facing multiple headwinds when it comes to making the shift to electric vehicles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Munster said traditional carmakers have two options in the future. The car companies can release a vehicle with similar features to Tesla vehicle and sell it at cost, which would be around 10% to 25% higher than the comparable Tesla vehicle. Or, traditional automakers can subsidize the vehicles to try and take away market share from Tesla, which will also result in increased losses.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;We believe car companies that have been around for 50+ years will eventually (10 years from now) be forced to restructure or go out of business.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>Munster also sees a bright future ahead for Tesla.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe the long-term opportunity remains intact: The company has a pole position in what will be a massive market transition to electrification,&rdquo; Munster said.</p>

<p><strong>TSLA Price Action</strong>: Tesla shares traded at $213.03 at the time of writing versus a 52-week trading range of $101.81 to $299.29. Shares are up 97% year-to-date in 2023 and were down around 15% over the last week.</p>

<title>Price Over Earnings Overview: Sherwin-Williams</title>

<pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 16:30:16 -0400</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Looking into the current session, <strong>Sherwin-Williams Inc. (NYSE:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SHW#NYSE">SHW</a>)</strong> shares are trading at $237.70, after a <strong>0.50%</strong> decrease. Over the past month, the stock fell by <strong>6.66%</strong>, but over the past year, it actually increased by <strong>11.84%</strong>. With questionable short-term performance like this, and great long-term performance, long-term shareholders might want to start looking into the company's price-to-earnings ratio. </p>
<p><p><img src="https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1697833812_0.png" alt="Past Year Chart" /></p></p>
<h3>Sherwin-Williams P/E Compared to Competitors</h3>
<p>The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E could indicate that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future or it could mean that the company is undervalued. </p>
<p>Sherwin-Williams has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of <strong>34.47</strong> of the Chemicals industry. Ideally, one might believe that the stock might perform worse than its peers, but it's also probable that the stock is undervalued. </p>
<p><p><img src="https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1697833812_1.png" alt="Guage" /></p></p>
<p>In summary, while the price-to-earnings ratio is a valuable tool for investors to evaluate a company's market performance, it should be used with caution. A low P/E ratio can be an indication of undervaluation, but it can also suggest weak growth prospects or financial instability. Moreover, the P/E ratio is just one of many metrics that investors should consider when making investment decisions, and it should be evaluated alongside other financial ratios, industry trends, and qualitative factors. By taking a comprehensive approach to analyzing a company's financial health, investors can make well-informed decisions that are more likely to lead to successful outcomes. </p>]]></description>

<pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 16:29:55 -0400</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Streaming giant <strong>Netflix Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NFLX#NASDAQ">NFLX</a>) has been around for 25 years and is a market leader in&nbsp;the streaming sector around the world. Here&rsquo;s a look back at the company&rsquo;s history and how an investment in its IPO<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/18/05/11764543/this-day-in-market-history-netflix-goes-public"> would have fared.</a></p>

<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Netflix ended the<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/23/10/35317946/netflix-stock-soars-following-q3-results-eps-beat-revenue-beat-strong-subscriber-growth"> third quarter with </a>247.15 million paid&nbsp;global subscribers, adding 8.8 million paid subscribers in the quarter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A quarterly report showcasing Netflix&#39;s revenue and earnings per share surpassing analyst predictions has driven the streaming giant&#39;s share price upwards.</p>

<p>The company was <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/netflix-trivia-25th-anniversary">founded </a>in 1997 and launched its website NetfFlix.com on April 14, 1998. Originally known as a DVD-by-mail rental service, Netflix found itself in competition with <strong>Blockbuster </strong>and other physical movie rental chains.</p>

<p>Blockbuster also launched its own DVD-by-mail rental service. A battle between Netflix and Blockbuster raged on for years, before Blockbuster eventually <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/company-news/10/08/445627/bye-bye-blockbuster-video-store-chain-to-file-bankruptcy-next-mont">filed for bankruptcy </a>in 2010 due to its high level of debt.</p>

<p>Back in 2000, Netflix <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/23/04/31801202/when-netflix-founders-tried-selling-the-company-to-amazon-blockbuster-they-laughed-us-out-o">pitched a deal</a> to be acquired by Blockbuster for $50 million. The pitch came as Netflix was among the companies feeling the effect of the dot-com market crash. Blockbuster executives are said to have laughed Netflix out of the room.</p>

<p>Before they pitched the company to Blockbuster for an acquisition, Netflix took a meeting with <strong>Amazon.com Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMZN#NASDAQ">AMZN</a>) back in 1998. Amazon founder <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>offered $15 million to acquire Netflix, but the company turned the deal down, believing they had more growth ahead.</p>

<p>The co-founders of Netflix who turned down the Amazon deal are likely happy they did, as are any investors who got in on the streaming company early.</p>

<p>Netflix held its IPO on May 29, 2002, offering 5.5 million shares at a price of $15. Shares posted triple-digit returns for investors over the first several years.</p>

<p>At the time of its IPO, Netflix had around 600,00 subscribers for its DVD-by-mail rental service. The company&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/23/04/31883368/after-25-years-of-incredible-run-netflix-breaks-up-with-dvds-its-not-you-its-streaming">recently ended its DVD-by-mail service.</a></p>

<p>Years later, in 2007, Netflix entered the next phase of growth <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/education/23/09/34988686/if-you-invested-1-000-in-netflix-stock-when-company-announced-streaming-launch-heres-how-much-y">by offering streaming</a> to subscribers as part of its existing DVD rental by mail service. Eventually, the company would transition to offering streaming and mail packages separately or as bundles.</p>

<p>In 2012, &ldquo;Lillyhammer&rdquo; became the first original series to hit the Netflix streaming platform. Over the years, Netflix has released plenty of hit shows like &ldquo;House of Cards,&rdquo; &ldquo;Stranger Things,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bridgerton,&rdquo; &quot;Squid Game&quot; and more.</p>

<p><strong>Investing $1,000 In Netflix Stock:</strong> Although investors couldn&#39;t predict Netflix&#39;s ascendancy as a streaming juggernaut or Blockbuster&#39;s eventual bankruptcy, they might have backed Netflix based on their personal experience as customers or their faith in the company&#39;s innovative vision and consistent growth.</p>

<p>At a price point of $15, an investor could have purchased 66.7 shares at the time of the Netflix IPO. Stock splits in 2004 (2-for-1) and 2015 (7-for-1) would have turned the $1,000 investment into 933.8 shares.</p>

<p>Based on a price of $404.70 for Netflix stock at the time of writing, the $1,000 investment would be worth $377,908.86 today. This represents a return of 37,690.9% for investors.</p>

<p>Netflix shares hit an all-time high of $691.69 on Nov. 17, 2021. The $1,000 investment would have been worth a staggering $645,900.12 at that time.</p>

<p>While past results don&rsquo;t always mean the future will be a success, Netflix remains a market leader in the streaming space and is gaining subscribers with a password-sharing crackdown and ad-supported plan launch.</p>

<pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 16:25:43 -0400</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>The FIFA gaming community is currently in turmoil due to a crippling glitch referred to as the &quot;Trickster glitch&quot;&nbsp;that has infiltrated<strong> Electronic Arts Inc&#39;</strong>s (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/EA#NASDAQ">EA</a>) EA Sports FC 24&#39;s highest-level <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/gaming/23/10/35247676/fc-tactical-is-eas-new-turn-based-soccer-rpg-game-for-2024">competitive multiplayer mode.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-fc-24-players-horrified-as-worst-ever-glitch-spreads-to-ultimate-team-weekend-league">According</a> to IGN, this glitch allows players with the Trickster+ playstyle to perform a skill move that attaches the ball to the back of their leg, enabling them to effortlessly score goals without any defense being able to prevent it.</p>

<p><em>See Also:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/23/02/30913320/gaming-giant-electronic-arts-takes-on-soccer-pays-588-million-for-premier-league-rights">Gaming Giant Electronic Arts Takes On Soccer: Pays $588 Million for Premier League Rights</a></em></p>

<p>FC 24 players initially used this exploit in Ultimate Team&#39;s Division Rivals mode, but it has now infiltrated the Weekend League, the game&#39;s highest-pressure player-versus-player mode.</p>

<p>EA Sports acknowledged the glitch but has only stated it is&nbsp;investigating it.</p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;ve added a new issue to the EASFC Tracker that we&#39;re investigating. The ball can incorrectly stick to a dribbler&#39;s leg as they run in some situations,&quot; the account EA SPORTS FC Direct Communication posted on X (formerly Twitter).</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Despite fans calling for a delay of the Weekend League to maintain competitive integrity, the weekly mode launched as planned. FC 24 players are now demanding EA Sports take punitive action against those who exploited the glitch and block rewards for affected matches.</p>

<p>In addition to this ongoing issue, FC 24&nbsp;also faced controversies related to microtransactions, including a $30 Ultimate Team pack offered for purchase before the game&#39;s official launch.</p>

<p>It&#39;s worth noting FC 24 launch sales in Europe were down compared to FIFA 23, which was a massive hit for EA, though this decline was anticipated following EA&#39;s severed relationship with FIFA.</p>

<title>Tether To Publish Reserve Data In Real-Time: Report</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>In a move towards greater transparency, <strong>Tether Holdings</strong>, the entity behind the stablecoin <strong>Tether</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/quote/">USDT</a>), is said to be revising its approach to publishing reserve data reports.</p>

<p>As the crypto community gears up for Benzinga&#39;s <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/go/crypto-conference-article-link">Future of Digital Assets</a> conference on Nov.&nbsp;14, this development from Tether will likely be a discussion topic. The conference aims to address the evolving landscape of digital assets, and&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Paolo Ardoino</strong>, soon to be the CEO and currently the chief technology officer of Tether, was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-20/tether-s-incoming-ceo-paolo-ardoino-inherits-crypto-s-stablecoin-giant-usdt?leadSource=uverify%20wall">quoted </a>by Bloomberg on Oct. 20, stating the company&#39;s intention to &quot;publish reserve data in real-time in 2024.&quot;</p>

<p>While Tether had&nbsp;yet to officially comment on this, its transparency page indicated&nbsp;that it&nbsp;currently updates its reserve data daily and provides monthly and quarterly reserve reports.</p>

<p>Benzinga has reached out to Ardoino for a comment.</p>

<p>Despite facing market challenges in 2023, Tether&#39;s performance has been noteworthy.</p>

<p>Data from its second quarter update revealed&nbsp;a 5.7% growth in assets, reaching a staggering $86.5 billion.</p>

<p>The company reported an &quot;operational profit&quot; exceeding $1 billion, marking a 30% uptick from the preceding quarter.</p>

<p>Interestingly, 2023 saw a revival in Tether&#39;s stablecoin lending activities, a significant shift considering it had ceased such loans entirely in December 2022.</p>

<p>Further insights from Tether&#39;s second quarter&nbsp;attestation, conducted by accounting firm BDO, highlighted an $850 million increase in excess reserves, totaling $3.3 billion.</p>

<p>Tether also revealed an indirect exposure of $72 billion to U.S. Treasuries&nbsp;via money market funds and U.S. Treasuries backing its overnight repo.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Amid&nbsp;organizational shifts and regulatory hurdles, <strong>Binance </strong>is <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/23/09/34900834/binance-attempts-a-belgium-comeback-just-3-months-after-watchdog-halted-services">bolstering its European</a> foothold with a fresh Euro services partnership.</p>

<p><strong>What Happened?</strong></p>

<p>Crypto exchange giant, Binance&nbsp;announced that it has signed agreements with new regulated and authorized fiat partners for EUR payments, deposits, and withdrawals, as reported on its <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/fiat/binance-expands-freedom-of-money-for-european-users-with-new-eur-fiat-partnerships-3923321843149867820">blog post</a>.</p>

<p>The new partnerships offer EUR transactions via Open Banking and SEPA/SEPA Instant, and buying and selling crypto with SEPA/SEPA Instant. Users have already started to shift to the new services.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Being able to easily convert fiat to crypto, and back to fiat again, is a crucial part of advancing the adoption of digital assets globally. Without an easy way to buy or sell crypto, users who are new to the space can find the process of buying or selling crypto unintuitive and intimidating,&rdquo; Binance said in its blog.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p>More EUR fiat channels have arrived on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Binance?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Binance</a><br />
<br />

<p>There is no disclosure of the names of the new service providers. However, a Blockworks <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/binance-europe-services-paysafe">report</a>&nbsp;cites&nbsp;a Binance spokesperson who said that the company has onboarded partners including fintech firm, TrueLayer, global payment tech company, Nuvei and several card acquirers.</p>

<p><strong>Paysafe Distancing And Other Challenges</strong></p>

<p>The move comes on the heels of <strong>Paysafe</strong> (NYSE:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/PSFE#NYSE">PSFE</a>), Binance&rsquo;s earlier Euro banking partner, <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/23/09/34980611/binances-paysafe-partnership-ends-users-advised-to-convert-eur-balances-to-usdt">ending its relationship&nbsp;with Binance</a> for providing any further operations in September.</p>

<p>PaySafe started showing signs of distance in May 2023 when Binance suspended deposits and withdrawals in British pounds until a new banking partner was secured. These signs were reflected as the exchange faced <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/23/10/35273208/binance-pauses-uk-registrations-due-to-regulatory-changes">legal inquiries from authorities in the U.K</a>., Japan, Italy, Singapore, Netherlands, Canada and Thailand.</p>

<p>Currently, Binance has halted operations in Germany, Netherlands, and Cyprus amid licensing issues. It has also announced plans to reduce its European footprint and focus on lesser-regulated entities. The exchange is currently <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/23/06/32718798/binance-and-changpeng-zhao-sued-by-the-sec-has-the-empire-just-started-crumbling">surrounded by regulatory challenges, legal actions</a> and some <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/23/07/33143894/changpeng-zhao-on-departure-of-key-binance-executives-dreamed-up-reasons-by-news-are-compl">executive departures.</a></p>

<title>How Is The Market Feeling About Truist Finl?</title>
<link>https://www.benzinga.com/short-sellers/23/10/35358200/how-is-the-market-feeling-about-truist-finl</link>
<guid>https://www.benzinga.com/short-sellers/23/10/35358200/how-is-the-market-feeling-about-truist-finl</guid>
<pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 16:15:26 -0400</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Truist Finl's</strong> (NYSE:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TFC#NYSE">TFC</a>) short percent of float has fallen 14.04% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has <strong>12.98 million shares sold short</strong>, which is 0.98% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, <strong>it would take traders 1.14 days to cover their short positions on average.</strong></p>
<h3>Why Short Interest Matters</h3>
<p>Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/how-to-short-a-stock/">Short selling</a> is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.</p>
<p>Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1697832923_0.png" alt="short_fig" /></p>

<p>As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Truist Finl has declined since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to rise in the near-term but traders should be aware that less shares are being shorted.</p>
<h3>Comparing Truist Finl's Short Interest Against Its Peers</h3>
<p>Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://pro.benzinga.com/">Benzinga Pro</a>, Truist Finl's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 4.57%, which means the company has <strong>less</strong> short interest than most of its peers.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>In honor of <strong>Snoop Dogg&rsquo;</strong>s birthday and his &ldquo;significant contributions to the popularization of marijuana,&rdquo;&nbsp;<strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong> declared the rapper&#39;s Oct. 20&nbsp;birthday&nbsp;to be &ldquo;DoggFather&rsquo;s Day,&quot; to be celebrated as a&nbsp;&ldquo;new high holiday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kimmel and his sidekick&nbsp;<strong>Guillermo Rodriguez</strong>&nbsp;proceeded to present Snoop with a mock proclamation made from an oversized box of rolling papers on Thursday&#39;s &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live.&quot;</p>

<p>Kimmel noted that &ldquo;Mr. Dogg&rsquo;s birthday falls on the exact midpoint to 4/20&mdash;a coincidence that is totally tripping me out right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kimmel explained that half-birthdays are a&nbsp;big thing in his family.</p>

<p>&quot;We sing Halfy Birthday, we have half a cake&rdquo;&mdash;and on 4/20 last year, &ldquo;I was sitting there thinking, &lsquo;I wonder what the half-birthday of 4/20 is.&#39;&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Then He Declared A New Holiday</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Why shouldn&rsquo;t this be a holiday?&nbsp;Mr. Dogg&rsquo;s birthday falls on the exact midpoint to 4/20.&quot;</p>

<p>Then&nbsp;Kimmel read the&nbsp;proclamation:&nbsp;&ldquo;Whereas, <strong>Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr.</strong>, known worldwide as Snoop Doggy Dogg, has made significant contributions to the popularization of <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/marijuana-stocks/">marijuana</a>&mdash;AKA weed, pot, ganja, herb, bud, trees, cheeba, kush, chronic, reefer, dank, sticky icky icky and jolly green giggle sticks.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whereas, Mr. Dogg&rsquo;s birthday miraculously&nbsp;falls on the exact midway point to 4/20&mdash;a coincidence that is totally tripping me out right now,&rdquo; Kimmel added.</p>

<p>The late-night host&nbsp;then encouraged the audience to bow their heads and join him in a chant: &ldquo;Bow-Wow-Wow Yippie-Yo-Yippie-Yay-men.&rdquo; He presented Snoop with what he said was the new &ldquo;Presidential Medal of Weedom.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>More on Snoop&#39;s smoking habits:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/22/11/29525943/snoop-dogg-microwaves-his-blunts-before-smoking-and-for-good-reason-heres-why">Snoop Dogg Microwaves His Blunts Before Smoking And For Good Reason, Here&#39;s Why</a></em></p>

<p>Snoop said he was speechless but then spoke up, declaring, &ldquo;one nation under a bud leaf...We gon&rsquo; blow one for the po&rsquo; one&rdquo; and pantomimed smoking a blunt.</p>

<p><em>Join the fun here!</em></p>

<title>FDA Approves BioMarin's VOXZOGO For Children Under 5 Years With Achondroplasia</title>

<pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2023 16:09:11 -0400</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p><i>Expanded Indication in the U.S. Now Includes Children of all ages with&nbsp;Achondroplasia</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/BMRN#NASDAQ">BMRN</a>), a global biotechnology company dedicated to transforming lives through genetic discovery, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for VOXZOGO&#xAE; (vosoritide) to increase linear growth in pediatric patients with achondroplasia with open epiphyses (growth plates). This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on an improvement in annualized growth velocity. Previously, VOXZOGO was indicated for children who were 5 years of age and older. This expanded indication now includes children of all ages with open growth plates.</p><p>"We are pleased that VOXZOGO is now available for children of all ages with achondroplasia," said Hank Fuchs, M.D., president of Worldwide Research and Development at BioMarin. "We are grateful for the collaboration of the achondroplasia community, physicians, and the children and their families who have played a crucial role in advancing this clinical program. We also look forward to further understanding the potential role of VOXZOGO in other genetic short stature conditions, including hypochondroplasia."</p><p>"VOXZOGO is the only approved treatment for children with achondroplasia. Until now, it has only been approved in the U.S. for children aged 5 and older with open growth plates," said William Wilcox, M.D., professor of human genetics at Emory University. "I am delighted that VOXZOGO is now approved for younger children where we hope to have potentially greater impact by starting treatment earlier and, as a result, a much longer treatment window."</p><p>BioMarin conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of VOXZOGO in children aged 5 and under (Study 111-206). Based on the results of this trial, together with evidence from the adequate and well controlled Phase 3 study in pediatric patients aged 5 years and older (Study 111-301), safety and effectiveness of VOXZOGO have been established in pediatric patients of all ages for the improvement in linear growth in children with achondroplasia with open epiphyses. The overall safety profile of VOXZOGO in children under 5 years of age was similar to that seen in older children.</p><p>Data from an open-label, long-term Phase 2 extension study was recently presented at the 2023 European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology Meeting in September. Over a four-year period, children aged 2 years and above who received VOXZOGO exhibited a mean (average) height Z-score improvement of 1.1 to 1.4 standard deviations (95% CI limits from 0.46 to 1.93) and a mean height gain of 6.3 to 7.8 centimeters (cm) (95% CI limits from 2.98 to 10.40 cm) when compared to untreated children with achondroplasia of the same age and sex. In addition, children under the age of 2 years, treated with VOXZOGO for three years, had a mean height Z-score improvement of 0.8 to 1.0 standard deviations (95% CI limits from 0.37 to 1.59) and a height gain between 3.5 and 3.9 cm (95% CI limits from 1.57 to 6.16 cm).</p><p>Since the introduction of VOXZOGO in 2021, the company has seen strong patient demand for the medicine worldwide. BioMarin has recently been able to secure increased fill-finish commitments in 2024 and beyond to meet this additional demand. There are approximately 800 children under 5 with achondroplasia in the U.S.</p><p>VOXZOGO is currently approved in Europe in children with achondroplasia who are 2 years of age and older with open growth plates. In September, the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion recommending marketing authorization to expand the indication for VOXZOGO for injection to treat children with achondroplasia aged 4 months and older whose epiphyses are not closed. A final approval decision, typically consistent with the CHMP recommendation, is expected from the European Commission later this year. &nbsp;</p><p>VOXZOGO is also approved in Japan in children from birth who have achondroplasia with open growth plates. In addition, it is approved in Brazil in children who are 6 months and older with open growth plates&nbsp;as well as in Australia in children with achondroplasia who are 2 years of age and older with open growth plates.</p><p><strong>Orphan Drug Designation in Hypochondroplasia</strong></p><p>VOXZOGO also recently received orphan drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of hypochondroplasia, a genetic condition caused by a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene and characterized by impaired bone growth. While similar to&nbsp;achondroplasia, people with hypochondroplasia typically present with milder disproportionality and less severe short stature compared to achondroplasia.</p><p>BioMarin plans to initiate a pivotal development program in hypochondroplasia later this year.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Volatility notably returned to the markets this week as investors navigated the escalating conflict between Israel and Hamas, remarks from Federal Reserve Chair <strong>Jerome Powell </strong>and mixed earning reports <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/calendars/earnings">from leading U.S. corporations.</a></p>



<p><strong>Powell Says Fed Can Proceed &#8216;Carefully,&#8217; Warns Of Further Hikes If Data Remains Strong: </strong>During an event organized by the Economic Club of New York, Fed Chair <strong>Jerome Powell</strong> emphasized the need for a "careful" approach by the Federal Reserve that considers economic data. He also hinted that if the economy&#8217;s strength and inflation resurgence continue to surprise, further interest rate hikes may <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/bonds/23/10/35337404/powells-interest-rate-remarks-trigger-thursday-roller-coaster-what-did-fed-chair-say">be on the horizon</a>. It was a week marked by significant volatility in Treasuries, with yields reaching 5% on 10-year bonds. </p>



<p>Rising bond yields pressured major stock indices, with the <strong>SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust</strong> (NYSE:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SPY#NYSE">SPY</a>) down 2.3% and the tech-heavy <strong>Invesco QQQ Trust</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/QQQ#NASDAQ">QQQ</a>) down 3% for the week.</p>



<p>Among sectors, only the <strong>Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund</strong> (NYSE:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/XLE#NYSE">XLE</a>) and the <strong>Consumer Staples</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Select Sector SPDR Fund</strong> (NYSE:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/XLP#NYSE">XLP</a>) have remained unscathed, showing marginal gains. </p>



<p><strong>US Retail Sales Continue To Surpass Expectations, Defying Inflation, Interest Rates:</strong> In September, U.S. retail sales marked the sixth consecutive month of increases, underscoring consumers&#8217; remarkable resilience despite rising inflation and higher interest rates. On an annual basis, retail sales surged by 3.8%, up from the upwardly revised 2.9% recorded in August, marking the most substantial year-over-year <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/economics/macro-economic-events/23/10/35286199/september-retail-sales-top-expectations-as-consumers-defy-high-inflation-interest">gain since February 2023</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Tesla Reports Lower-Than-Expected Q3 Results, Stock Faces Worst Week Of 2023:</strong> <strong>Tesla Inc.</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ">TSLA</a>) reported third-quarter earnings and revenue below expectations. Revenue reached $23.35 billion, a 9% increase from the previous year but falling short of the Street&#8217;s $24.38-billion estimate. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 66 cents, also missing predictions. The company announced plans to commence deliveries of the <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/23/10/35318136/tesla-q3-earnings-highlights-revenue-miss-eps-miss-cybertruck-launch-set-for-november-and-more">new Cybertruck in November.</a> Tesla&#8217;s stock experienced a 15.2% decline for the week, marking its worst weekly performance this year. </p>

<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Bitcoin</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/quote/btc/usd">BTC</a>) was leading the crypto sector higher during Friday&rsquo;s 24-hour trading session amid optimism that the approval of a<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/23/10/35349102/bitcoin-breaches-30-000-for-first-time-since-august-whats-driving-the-surge"> spot Bitcoin ETF is on the horizon</a>.</p>

<p><strong>BlackRock</strong> and <strong>Fidelity</strong> introduced changes to their spot Bitcoin ETF submissions at the beginning of the week, while <strong>Grayscale</strong> filed an S-3 application as part of its efforts to secure similar approvals.</p>

<p>From a technical analysis perspective, Bitcoin was attempting to break up from a triple inside bar pattern. Ethereum and Dogecoin were unable to break up above their Oct. 16 high, causing the cryptos to remain trading in symmetrical triangle patterns.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/stock-chart-patterns">A symmetrical triangle pattern</a> is created when a stock forms a series of lower highs and higher lows between a descending and an ascending trendline, which meet on the right side of the chart to form an apex. The pattern indicates that the bulls and bears are equally in control.</p>

<p>A symmetrical triangle is often formed on lower-than-average volume and demonstrates a decrease in volatility, indicating consolidation. The decreasing volume is often followed by a sharp increase in volume when the stock breaks up or down from the pattern, which should happen before the stock reaches the apex of the triangle.</p>

<p><strong>The Bitcoin Chart:</strong> For the last three trading days, Bitcoin&rsquo;s trading range has taken place within the Oct. 16 mother bar, which settled the crypto into a triple inside bar pattern. The pattern leans bullish for continuation because Bitcoin has been trading in a strong uptrend.</p>

<p>During Friday&rsquo;s trading session, Bitcoin temporarily broke above the top of the mother bar but ran into a group of sellers near $30,000, which caused a retracement. The spike caused Bitcoin to form another higher high, however, which confirmed&nbsp;the uptrend remains intact.</p>

<p>When Bitcoin surged on Oct. 16, the crypto regained support at the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), which indicates Bitcoin is trading in a bull cycle. If Bitcoin can remain above the 200-day SMA for a period of time, the 50-day SMA will cross above the 200-day, which would cause a golden cross to form.</p>

<p>A loss of the 200-day SMA on big bearish volume could be an exit signal for bullish traders holding a position.</p>

<p>Bitcoin has resistance above at $30,050 and at $31,418 and support below at $28,690 and at $27,133.</p>

<p><img alt="screenshot_61.png" src="https://www.benzinga.com/files/u278075/screenshot_61.png" style="height:427px; width:760px" /><strong>The Ethereum and Dogecoin Charts:</strong> Ethereum and Dogecoin began trading in symmetrical triangle patterns on Oct. 3 and Oct. 2, respectively. The patterns lean bearish in this case but the upward trajectory of Bitcoin may cause Ethereum and Dogecoin to break bullishly from the formation.,</p>

<p>Ethereum and Dogecoin have both been making a series of higher lows and lower highs as their trading range tightens. When the cryptos attempted to break up from the triangles, Ethereum and Dogecoin both rejected the 50-day SMA, indicating the cryptos are trading in bear cycles.</p>

<p>Bullish traders want to see Ethereum and Dogecoin regain the 50-day SMA as support, which will also cause the cryptos to break up from their triangles. Bearish traders want to see big bearish volume come in and cause the cryptos to break down from the triangles, which will throw Ethereum and Dogecoin into downtrends.</p>

<p>Ethereum has resistance above at $1,615 and at $1,717 and support below at $1,564 and at $1,421.</p>

<p><img alt="screenshot_62.png" src="https://www.benzinga.com/files/u278075/screenshot_62.png" style="height:427px; width:760px" />Dogecoin has resistance above at $0.061 and at $0.065 and support below at $0. 057 and at $0.055.</p>

<h1>What Are Analyst Ratings?</h1>
<p>Analysts are specialists within banking and financial systems that typically report for specific stocks or within defined sectors. These people research company financial statements, sit in conference calls and meetings, and speak with relevant insiders to determine what are known as analyst ratings for stocks. Typically, analysts will rate each stock once a quarter. </p>
<p>Some analysts also offer predictions for helpful metrics such as earnings, revenue, and growth estimates to provide further guidance as to what to do with certain tickers. It is important to keep in mind that while stock and sector analysts are specialists, they are also human and can only forecast their beliefs to traders.</p>

The official said the aim of the summit is to "drive more inclusive and sustainable economic growth, and tackle the underlying economic drivers of irregular migration in our hemisphere."</p><p>During the summit, leaders are expected to establish three discrete tracks, in finance, trade and foreign affairs, for countries to quickly begin to set specific goals and the processes to start executing them, the official also said.</p><p>The gathering comes as the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-100-billion-request-congress-ukraine-israel/">president is asking Congress for roughly $6.4 billion</a> to shore up border security programs, a response to growing bipartisan concerns on Capitol Hill, plus notable public ire from Democratic governors and big-city mayors about how the Biden administration is struggling to respond to a record-setting number of illegal border crossings. Republican presidential candidates continue to criticize the Biden administration's immigration and border security policies — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has even called for the use of U.S. military forces along the southern border to keep drug cartels from smuggling across fentanyl and other illegal drugs.&nbsp;</p><p>A record&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/venezuelan-migrants-us-mexico-border-september-numbers/">approximately 50,000 migrants from crisis-stricken Venezuela</a>&nbsp;crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in September, while thousands are still coming from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and other countries. In response, the Biden administration this week&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-venezuela-deportations-reduce-record-border-arrivals/">restarted direct deportations to Venezuela</a>, resuming a practice suspended amid strained relations with the government of the country's leader, Nicolas Maduro. Amid a widespread economic crisis, Venezuelans are leaving their homeland in record numbers, the largest refugee exodus recorded in the Western Hemisphere according to the United Nations.&nbsp;</p><p>But this week, Maduro's government and representatives of opposition parties agreed to restart negotiations that could lead to free presidential elections next year and the release of political prisoners, moves that could prompt the Biden administration to ease sanctions on the country's oil industry. That relief is also dependent on whether Maduro follows through with the release of three Americans — Eyvin Hernandez, Jerrel Kenemore, and Joseph Cristella — who are classified by the State Department as "wrongfully detained."&nbsp;</p><p>The emergency spending request submitted Friday by the White House to Congress asks for $4.4 billion for the Department of Homeland Security to build new immigrant holding facilities and to reimburse the Pentagon for military support along the border.&nbsp;</p><p>The administration's request includes a $1.9 billion ask for the Department of Health and Human Service's ongoing care and support for unaccompanied migrant children and families, plus a $204 million request to pay for a Trump-era policy requiring the Justice Department to collect DNA samples from hundreds of thousands of asylum-seekers and migrants crossing annually. &nbsp;</p><p>It is not yet clear if the leaders of all 11 countries plan to attend the summit, but invitations to various events to be held on the sidelines of the summit began circulating around Washington this week. The meetings are the brainchild of Christopher J. Dodd, a special presidential adviser for the Americas whose State Department perch gives him wide latitude over western hemisphere policy. A longtime friend of the president and former Peace Corps volunteer in the Dominican Republic, he's one of the most seasoned American policymakers on Latin America. &nbsp;</p><p>Leaders of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras – three countries from whom tens of thousands of people have fled in recent years and through which tens of thousands of others must traverse on their way to Mexico and the United States – were not invited to the summit because they did not join the APEP accords last year, according to diplomats familiar with the planning. All three countries have frosty relations with the Biden administration given concerns about a loosening of democratic norms and tougher law enforcement policies that have led to the wrongful imprisonment of thousands of people, especially in El Salvador.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>This article was originally published on <a href="https://cannabis.net/blog/medical/athletes-say-cannabis-is-best-for-exercise-recovery-lactic-acid-build-up-and-muscle-repair-acco">Cannabis.net</a> and appears here with permission.</p>

<p>For&nbsp;<a href="https://cannabis.net/blog/sports/athletes-who-train-with-cannabis-win-gold">athletes</a>, proper rest and recovery is just as important for overall&nbsp;<a href="https://cannabis.net/blog/sports/how-cbd-can-improve-athletic-performance">health and performance</a>&nbsp;as training.</p>

<p>Athletes can benefit from both passive and active recovery. Aside from these, getting enough sleep is critical because lack of sleep can significantly affect your performance for several days. These practices work together to help athletes perform their best while ensuring they stay healthy from the inside out. That&rsquo;s because&nbsp;<a href="https://cannabis.net/blog/medical/top-cannabis-strains-for-exercise-and-recovery">recovery</a>&nbsp;is necessary for the well-being of athletes, and just about anyone who exercises regularly.</p>

<p>There are several tools that can&nbsp;<a href="https://cannabis.net/blog/medical/5-ways-cbd-can-boost-the-athletic-side-of-you">help athletes</a>&nbsp;recover more efficiently. Over the past few years, there has been a growing interest among athletes and sports circles in the use of marijuana products for recovery. It&rsquo;s been backed up by studies, too.</p>

<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10403841/">recent study</a>&nbsp;conducted by Kent State University researchers involved polling more than 100 participants who used cannabis while regularly performing resistance and/or aerobic training. The data, which was published in the medical journal, the Journal of Cannabis Research, revealed that <a href="https://elplanteo.com/aceite-cbd-ansiedad/">cannabidiol</a> (CBD) as well as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) was found to be helpful for athletes in recovery.</p>

<p class="core-block"><em class="core-block"><strong class="core-block">See also: <a class="core-block" href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/21/11/23825005/study-shows-cannabis-consumers-are-successful-motivated-health-conscious-snoop-dogg-weighs-in" target="_blank">Snoop Dogg Shatters Cannabis Clich&eacute;s: Consumers Are Highly Educated, Successful, Motivated</a></strong></em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Twenty-two participants (20%) reported using CBD for recovery from aerobic exercise and 25 participants (23%) reported CBD use to recover from resistance exercise,&rdquo; they wrote. Around 60% of them also used THC for the same purpose. When the participants were polled on whether they felt that cannabis was helpful for recovery, a majority of them answered yes (93%).</p>

<p>On the other hand, a majority of respondents who consumed THC said that it was used for the &ldquo;pleasant feelings&rdquo; it evoked as well as for fun and relaxation. They did say that they experienced side effects from using THC, which for them meant getting too high, uncontrollable laughter, sleepiness, and heart racing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The present study demonstrated that in addition to more traditional recovery methods, cannabis use is an ergogenic recovery aid by individuals that exercise regularly&hellip; More data are necessary to understand the role of cannabis in exercise recovery as well as perceived ergogenic benefits of cannabis by individuals who both regularly participate in exercise and habitually use cannabis,&rdquo; concluded the authors.</p>

<p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37440169/#article-details">another study</a>&nbsp;whose results were published in July 2023 in Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research found that marijuana-consuming runners experienced a great improvement in their performance and even recovery because of pot. According to the authors, since marijuana use together with exercise has been attracting attention over the last few years, it has effectively contradicted the famous stereotype that marijuana users are lazy and sedentary. Because of this, they wanted to have a better understanding of the link between exercise and cannabis use by comparing the experiences of runners who consumed legal cannabis and non-using runners.</p>

<p>Forty-nine marijuana-consuming subjects whose ages ranged from 21 to 49 were then analyzed. They found that 3.88 miles was the average distance both groups ran. &ldquo;Although participants ran an average of 31 seconds/mile slower during their cannabis run, this difference was not statistically significant,&rdquo; they wrote. However, subjects &ldquo;reported lower pain levels after their cannabis run,&rdquo; they wrote.</p>

<p><em><strong>See also: <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/biotech/23/10/35316350/nobel-prize-winner-views-medical-cannabis-as-a-real-therapeutic-treatment-free-of-mysticism">Nobel Prize Winner Views Medical Cannabis As &#39;A Real Therapeutic Treatment...Free Of Mysticism&#39;</a></strong></em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Results suggest that acute cannabis use may be associated with a more positive exercise experience among regular cannabis users. Research using varied methodologies, a range of exercise modalities, and diverse populations is needed to establish the long-term harms and benefits associated with this behavior, as well as the generalizability of these findings to other populations and settings,&rdquo; the authors concluded.</p>

<p><strong>How Else Can Weed Positively Impact Your Workout?</strong></p>

<p>Depending on your experience with cannabis, you may find that cannabis use for athletic performance is either controversial or &ndash; makes total sense. But the science is there, and more elite sports groups have already banned cannabis testing, with more expected to do so in the future.</p>

<p>Additionally, athletes can&rsquo;t deny the benefits. You don&rsquo;t even have to be a professional athlete to yield the benefits of cannabis for your workout. There are many ways it can benefit your regular workout, such as:</p>

<p><strong>Pain relief</strong>:<a href="https://cannabis.net/blog/medical/cannabis-strains-vs.-chronic-pain">&nbsp;Pain</a>&nbsp;is one of the most established conditions that cannabis can effectively and safely treat. Both THC and CBD have been found to be successful at treating inflammation, including inflammation caused by strenuous workouts and muscle soreness, which lead to pain.</p>

<p><strong>Stimulate your appetite</strong>: Weightlifters, boxers, or anyone who wants to build up mass and muscle can benefit from the&nbsp;<a href="https://cannabis.net/blog/medical/top-5-cannabis-strains-for-appetite-loss">appetite-inducing benefits</a>&nbsp;of marijuana. The THC content in certain cannabis strains and products is known for its infamous effect of inducing &ldquo;the munchies&rdquo;, but use it properly by eating the right foods necessary to meet your target weight in a healthy manner. THC acts on the brain&rsquo;s <a href="https://elplanteo.com/receptores-cb1/">CB1</a> receptors, which are also responsible for regulating appetite. You can hit two birds with one stone: benefit from the pain-relieving and relaxing properties of THC while also stimulating your appetite.</p>

<p>A word of caution, though: if you have asthma or other lung disorders, it&rsquo;s best to avoid smoking weed for exercise and/or recovery. Instead, opt to ingest weed in other forms that don&rsquo;t pass through your lungs. There are many choices for that these days, including edibles, oils, beverages, tinctures, and topicals. Invest time in experimenting on various products recommended by budtenders at licensed dispensaries to improve athletic performance. Some fitness enthusiasts prefer CBD only, while others prefer a low THC/high CBD ratio or high THC. The results will vary depending on your body and your own athletic needs.</p>]]></description>

<p>For decades, growers have been focused on producing cannabis strains with the highest THC content possible to have a maximum high. High-THC means you&rsquo;re getting baked, whether sativa, indica or a mix of the two. Now, however, we know CBD can be therapeutic, healing parts of the plant and growers are focusing on high-CBD cannabis that places <a href="https://elplanteo.com/que-es-el-thc/">THC</a> in the backseat. &nbsp;What are the effects of smoking low-THC, high-CBD cannabis? And what are the benefits?</p>

<p>While CBD doesn&rsquo;t get the patient high, it does provide a sense of well-being and calm. CBD from hemp is legal across the US, while CBD from cannabis is only legal in states that allow for medical and recreational usage. What about a combination?</p>

<p>For one thing, there will be a change in mood, just not a drastic one that either has you talking a mile a minute or locked to the couch. The feeling is cerebral and one of well-being. The low-THC cannabis makes you feel comfortable in your own skin and has the healing benefits of whole-plant medication.</p>

However, there must be more research to better understand the benefits and how the combination can enhance medical treatments.</p>

<p>So consuming low-THC, high-CBD bud is a little like smoking with the three bears. The high THC strain gets you really high, while the hemp CBD strain doesn&rsquo;t get you high at all. The strain that has a little THC and a lot of CBD? It&rsquo;s just right to have you feeling on cloud nine without altering your state to an extreme.</p>

<p>And beyond being &ldquo;better than nothing,&rdquo; the high you get added to the relief you feel equals an experience that leaves a lasting impression and will likely have you going back to the bong. It&rsquo;s nearly impossible to get &ldquo;too high&rdquo; on low-THC cannabis, but you are able to find the bliss level.</p>

<p>So as growers expand their lines to include these new forms of medicinal marijuana, they are bound to continue improving upon the genetics, coaxing all the more <a href="https://elplanteo.com/cbd-gummies-mitos-verdades/">CBD</a> out and finding the most beneficial cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids to create the finest low-THC, high-CBD cannabis out there.

<title>A Brighter Future For Desperate Hemp Farmers? Cornell Research Could Make It Possible, Here's How</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Foundation for Food &amp; Agriculture Research</strong>&rsquo;s (FFAR)<strong> Hemp Research Consortium </strong>provided two grants totaling $1.17 million to Cornell University to support a long-term breeding program to cultivate hemp for grain, fiber and CBD production in U.S. growing regions. Consortium partners contributed matching funds for a total investment of $2.34 million.</p>

<h3>Why It Matters</h3>

<p>U.S.-grown hemp crops can yield additional plant protein, health and personal care products, consumer textiles and industrial applications.</p>

<p>Hemp may also be a viable alternative crop for tobacco-dependent and economically distressed farmers.</p>

<p>However, because Canada and Europe have longer days than the U.S. during the summer growing season, hemp varieties from these areas tend to result in smaller yields and thus limited profit when grown in the U.S. This is particularly true in sub-tropical regions such as Florida.</p>

<p>Cornell researchers aim to understand the genetic basis of the photoperiod threshold, which is the amount of light a plant needs to achieve flowering and other types of development.</p>

<p><em>See also: <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/08/33661988/lack-of-oversight-continues-to-hurt-hemp-industry-what-to-expect-from-2023-farm-bill">Lack Of Oversight Continues To Hurt Hemp Industry, What To Expect From 2023 Farm Bill</a></em></p>

<h3>The Research</h3>

<p>The researchers are also<strong> </strong>developing varieties of hemp that will deliver higher yields, especially at lower latitudes in the U.S.</p>

<p>These plants are specifically bred for desired traits, using a marker-assisted selection that shows promise in southern latitudes and has specific desirable characteristics. Marker-assisted selection uses markers such as DNA linked to desired features to choose plants for breeding. Those new cultivars show improved grain and fiber yields and undetectable levels of THC, making them fully compliant with THC regulations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With its potential for hundreds of food and industrial applications, hemp can be a major cash crop in the U.S<strong>.</strong>,&rdquo; <strong>Dr. Angela Records,</strong> FFAR chief scientific officer&nbsp;said. &ldquo;This research will contribute to a burgeoning hemp industry by acclimating the crop to a variety of growing regions across the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The research team is led by <strong>Dr. Larry Smart,</strong> a professor at Cornell&rsquo;s School of Integrative Plant Science Horticulture Section Plant Breeding and Genetics Section.</p>

<title>FDA Approves PENBRAYA, The First And Only Vaccine For The Prevention Of The Five Most Common Serogroups Causing Meningococcal Disease In Adolescents</title>

<description><![CDATA[<ul><li><i>PENBRAYA</i>&#x2122;<i> provides the broadest serogroup coverage (meningococcal groups A, B, C, W and Y) of any meningococcal vaccine available in the U.S. and has the potential to help simplify complex vaccination schedule in the U.S.</i></li><li><i>The FDA's decision is based on data from Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials, which demonstrated that PENBRAYA has robust immunogenicity non-inferior to Trumenba&#xAE; + Menveo&#xAE; for all serogroups and was well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile</i></li><li><i>The vaccine further advances Pfizer's vaccine portfolio and builds on more than 20 years of expertise and knowledge in the prevention of meningococcal disease</i></li></ul><p>Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/PFE#NYSE">PFE</a>) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved PENBRAYA&#x2122; (meningococcal groups A, B, C, W and Y vaccine), the first and only pentavalent vaccine that provides coverage against the most common serogroups causing meningococcal disease in adolescents and young adults 10 through 25 years of age. PENBRAYA combines the components from two meningococcal vaccines, Trumenba&#xAE; (meningococcal group B vaccine) and Nimenrix&#xAE; (meningococcal groups A, C, W-135, and Y conjugate vaccine) to help protect against the five most common meningococcal serogroups that cause the majority of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) globally.1</p><p>"As a pioneer in vaccines, one of our goals is to deliver vaccines that evolve the paradigm and help simplify the standard of care in the U.S.," said Annaliesa Anderson, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Head, Vaccine Research and Development, Pfizer. "Today marks an important step forward in the prevention of meningococcal disease in the U.S. In a single vaccine, PENBRAYA has the potential to protect more adolescents and young adults from this severe and unpredictable disease by providing the broadest meningococcal coverage in the fewest shots."</p><p>Meningococcal disease is an uncommon but serious illness that can lead to death within 24 hours and, for survivors, can result in life-altering, significant long-term disabilities.2 PENBRAYA reduces the total number of doses needed for individuals to be fully vaccinated against the five most common serogroups, thereby streamlining the standard of care and potentially increasing the number of adolescents and young adults vaccinated.3 According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), combining vaccines into fewer shots may mean that more adolescents and young adults get their recommended vaccines on time, resulting in fewer delays in protection against serious diseases.4 Routine use of PENBRAYA could also reduce IMD cases and associated mortality, the rate of long-term consequences of infection (sequelae) in survivors and costs associated with controlling outbreaks.5</p><p>"Nearly 9 out of 10 adolescents have incomplete protection against invasive meningococcal disease caused by the leading serogroups6," said Jana Shaw, MD, Pediatrics Infectious Disease Specialist, Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital in Syracuse, NY. "For the first time, we have a single vaccine that helps protect against the five most common serogroups and has the potential to improve coverage and increase protection among adolescents and young adults."</p><p>The FDA's decision is based on the positive results from the Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials, including a randomized, active-controlled and observer-blinded Phase 3 trial assessing the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the pentavalent vaccine candidate compared to currently U.S. licensed meningococcal vaccines, with the goal of determining immunologic noninferiority.

<description><![CDATA[<p>Two American hostages, <strong>Judith Raanan</strong> and her daughter <strong>Natalie</strong>, 18, were released by Hamas on Friday afternoon and subsequently transferred into the custody of the Red Cross, according to the Israeli government.They are reportedly <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/topic/israel">under the care Israeli authorities. </a></p>



<p>Raanan and her daughter are from Evanston, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, and they had embarked on a trip to Israel earlier this month to partake in the festivities surrounding a relative&#8217;s 85th birthday and the Jewish holiday season. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Two of the hostages, mother and daughter Yehudit Tai and Natali Shoshana Raanan were released by the Hamas terror organization and were transferred to the Israeli border via the Red Cross.<br><br>They are on their way to an army base in central Israel were their families are anxiously… <a href="https://t.co/xCGFfVEQa1">pic.twitter.com/xCGFfVEQa1</a></p>&mdash; Israel ישראל &#x1f1ee;&#x1f1f1; (@Israel) <a href="https://twitter.com/Israel/status/1715439615962702145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p><strong>Ghazi Hamad</strong>, a Hamas political bureau member, called the release a goodwill gesture during an exclusive interview with <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2023/10/19/israel-hamas-war-live-condemnation-after-israeli-strike-on-gaza-church">Al Jazeera</a>. Hamas is ready for constructive talks about prisoners, he said, but insisted that Israeli airstrikes in Gaza must stop. Hamas is treating the captives with dignity and respect, Hamad said, adding the release was facilitated through Qatari mediation. </p>



<p>Conversely, CNN reports that Hamas released the Americans due to the mother&#8217;s declining health, while the Times of Israel suggested the United States had also played a role in these efforts.</p>



<p>The U.S. and European governments are pushing Israel to delay its Gaza ground invasion to give diplomacy an opportunity to free other hostages held by Hamas.</p>



<p>The Israeli military has ordered for the immediate evacuation of Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City, calling upon all occupants to relocate to the southern region. Presently, the hospital is catering to the needs of 400 patients and roughly 12,000 displaced civilians.</p>



<p>Lebanese Foreign Minister <strong>Abdallah Bou Habib</strong> is urging Israel to announce a 48-hour ceasefire. According to Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Lt. Col. <strong>Peter Lerner </strong>in his conversation with <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-10-20-23/index.html">CNN</a>, it is the Lebanese government&#8217;s responsibility to ensure that terrorist groups like Hezbollah refrain from launching attacks against Israel.</p>



<p>President<strong> Joe Biden </strong>has said the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt should be ready to reopen within the next 24-48 hours to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Market Reactions</h2>



<p>During the entire trading session on Friday in New York, stocks remained consistently under pressure. </p>



<p>The S&amp;P 500 Index, as tracked by the <strong>SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust</strong> (NYSE:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SPY#NYSE">SPY</a>), recorded a 0.9% decline, while the tech-focused <strong>Invesco QQQ Trust</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/QQQ#NASDAQ">QQQ</a>) saw a 1.1% decrease.</p>



<p>Investors opted for safer assets, resulting in gains for both Treasuries and gold. The <strong>iShares 20+ Year Treasury ETF</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TLT#NASDAQ">TLT</a>) rose by 0.6%, and the <strong>SPDR Gold Trust </strong>(NYSE:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GLD#NYSE">GLD</a>) showed a 0.4% increase.</p>

<p>Using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC),&nbsp;&rdquo;the same tech favored by nearly all testing labs,&rdquo;&nbsp;the new tool aims to support data-driven decisions on strain selection, harvest optimization, extraction, accurate dosing, and safety.</p>

<p>Designed for licensed operators and research institutions and yet reportedly holding a portable, non-technical user type, LightLab was initially developed for cannabis testing applications and now aims to play a pivotal&nbsp;role in cultivation, production and regulatory applications for psychedelics.</p>

<p>Orange Photonics aims to provide accurate, reliable and innovative analytical testing solutions for several industries. Since 2015, LighLab 3 technology has been used by cannabis operators as well as state and federal regulators,&nbsp;reportedly including&nbsp;the FDA ,&nbsp;universities and research institutions.</p>

<p>Orange&rsquo;s president<strong> Stephanie McArdle</strong> says LightLab represents the opportunity to incorporate on-site potency analysis into every element of manufacturing and regulation.</p>

<p>&quot;Psychedelics product producers are in a position to ensure consumer safety is a primary focus. LightLab 3 Psy Analyzer is optimized for that critical role,&quot; McArdle stated.</p>

<p>The cancellation came&nbsp;as the conflict in the Middle East, particularly the Israel-Gaza war, intensified, Deadline <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/10/paramount-cancels-2023-mtv-emas-in-paris-israel-gaza-crisis-1235578010/">reported.</a></p>

<p>France is on high alert following the recent murder of a schoolteacher in the wake of a Hamas-led attack on Israel. Several airports, including Nice, were temporarily evacuated due to security threats.</p>

<p>Paramount cited concerns for the safety of thousands of employees, crew members, artists, fans&nbsp;and partners who come from around the world to participate in the event.</p>

<p>&quot;The MTV EMAs are an annual celebration of global music. As we watch the devastating events in Israel and Gaza continue to unfold, this does not feel like a moment for a global celebration. With thousands of lives already lost, it is a moment of mourning,&quot; a Paramount spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Paramount expressed hope to host the MTV EMAs again in November 2024, prioritizing the safety and well-being of all involved, acknowledging that the current global situation is not conducive to a celebratory event.</p>

<p>This cancellation follows a trend of postponements and cancellations of events due to the Israel-Gaza crisis.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Denmark: Medical Marijuana Pilot Program Experience 90% Growth In 12 Months </strong></h3>

<p>The number of patients enrolled in Denmark&rsquo;s medical cannabis pilot trial grew more than 90% in 12 months,&nbsp;<a href="https://businessofcannabis.com/denmarks-medical-cannabis-pilot-programme-has-seen-90-growth-over-the-last-year/" target="_blank">writes</a>&nbsp;Business of Cannabis.</p>

<p>According to the report from the Danish Health Data Authority, the number of patients involved in the medical marijuana Pilot Programme, which commenced in 2018, hit record numbers in 2023. Now, it makes for the biggest access scheme in the country.</p>

<p>With medical marijuana not being completely regulated in Denmark there are various access schemes, such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Magistral Scheme</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; under which patients can access only products with CBD and THC isolates, so do not contain the cannabinoids present in full spectrum oils;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>&nbsp;Pilot Programme</strong>&nbsp;- allows all doctors to prescribe any of the unlicensed medicines that have been approved for trial for any condition;&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Pharmaceutical Scheme</strong>, which only allows&nbsp;<strong>Jazz Pharmaceuticals&#39;</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/JAZZ#NASDAQ">JAZZ</a>) Sativex and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/topic/epidiolex" target="_blank">Epidoloex</a>.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The popularity rise of the Pilot scheme could be attributed to several reasons among which are: the ability for any doctor to prescribe, the products based on the full spectrum cannabis plant, said&nbsp;<strong>Thomas Skovlund Schnegelsberg</strong>, CEO of Danish medical cannabis operator&nbsp;<strong>Stenocare</strong>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This means you don&rsquo;t get the entourage effect that, according to the doctors that I&rsquo;ve talked to&hellip; say they see a higher efficacy with the full spectrum, with all the cannabinoids,&rdquo; Schnegelsberg said. He also added that the number revealed a preference shift to oils from flower.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Malta: Government Employee-Led Cannabis Club Breaks&nbsp;Advertising Rules&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>One of the first provisionally licensed &ldquo;cannabis clubs&rdquo; in Malta, Sprawt Chra, seems to have violated the rules on advertising with its recent Facebook post,&nbsp;which was deleted,&nbsp;<a href="https://theshiftnews.com/2023/10/19/government-employee-cannabis-club-licensee-deletes-facebook-page-after-possible-rules-breach/" target="_blank">writes</a>&nbsp;the Shift.</p>

<p>Under Malta&rsquo;s cannabis law, only &ldquo;cannabis harm reduction associations&rdquo; are licensed and regulated to grow and sell cannabis. These associations must be non-profit, can only sell their product&nbsp;and are not allowed to advertise, put cannabis in the name&nbsp;or promote marijuana use in any way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Based in Żebbuġ, Sprawt,&nbsp;one of two associations to obtain an &ldquo;in-principle&rdquo; license, which means it was allowed to start the construction of cultivation facilities, but not to grow plants until it is granted a full permit. Sprawt is managed by a government employee as its key officer and treasurer is <strong>Andrew Cassar Overend</strong> who works at the National Development and Social Fund and was previously an economics officer in the Ministry of Finance and Employment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the controversial post, Sprawt invited people to embark on a &ldquo;weed-loving journey&rdquo; with &ldquo;sizzling events, blazing giveaways, and pot-tastic surprises.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The post and the entire Sprawt Facebook page have been deleted most likely due to the violation of advertising rules.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Ireland: College Of General Practitioners Warns About Cannabis Use&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icgp.ie/speck/properties/asset/asset.cfm?type=Document&amp;id=36DA4388-E0B0-4B09-BF7878E6FF5E8C0B&amp;property=document&amp;filename=ICGP_Statement_on_Cannabis.pdf&amp;revision=tip&amp;mimetype=application%2Fpdf&amp;app=icgp&amp;disposition=inline" target="_blank">issued a new statement</a>&nbsp;on cannabis use, strongly opposing possible legalization in the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cannabis is a dangerous drug and a serious public health concern,&rdquo; reads the document issued by <strong>Dr. Diarmuid Quinlan</strong>, the ICGP&rsquo;s medical director. The ICGP discourages cannabis use, especially in high-risk populations such as youth, those with a personal or family history of mental disorder, pregnant women, and women who are breastfeeding,&rdquo;</p>

<p>The statement comes ahead of the final meeting of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Drugs Use, which is scheduled for this weekend,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-41251747.html" target="_blank">writes</a>&nbsp;the Irish Examiner. The assembly is supposed to put together a report for the Oireachtas on recommendations to reduce harm caused by illegal drugs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ICGP also confirmed that there&rsquo;s evidence suggesting cannabis offers potential therapeutic benefits, it adds that there are &ldquo;notable public health and health impacts associated with its use.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why it &ldquo;encourages the HSE and Department of Health to improve surveillance efforts to ensure data is available on the short- and long-term health effects of cannabis, especially emergency department visits and hospitalizations, impaired driving, workplace impairment and worker-related injury and safety, and prevalence of psychiatric and addictive disorders, including cannabis use disorder.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The IGCP noted it is behind public-health-based strategies, rather than incarcerations (in relation to individuals owning small amounts of marijuana for personal use), and is inviting for further research into the safety and effectiveness of cannabinoid-based medicinal products.</p>

<h3><strong>Switzerland: Explores Barcelona&#39;s Cannabis Social Club Model&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In October, a group of Swiss public health professionals involved in the Zurich pilot cannabis program visited a local cannabis social club in Barcelona,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iceers.org/swiss-professionals-explore-barcelonas-cannabis-social-club-model/" target="_blank">writes</a>&nbsp;Iceers. The idea behind the visit was to compare the programs and exchange experiences on harm reduction strategies.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Intuitive Surgical Inc&nbsp;</strong>(NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ISRG#NASDAQ">ISRG</a>) shares fell by around 3%. Several analysts&nbsp;<a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.benzinga.com/quote/ISRG/analyst-ratings" style="color:#4a6ee0; background:transparent; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt" target="_blank">lowered estimates</a>&nbsp;post Q3 FY23 earnings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ISRG reported quarterly earnings of $1.46 per share, which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $1.41, and sales of $1.74 billion, which missed the analyst&nbsp;<a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/23/10/35339565/intuitive-surgical-clocks-mixed-q3-earnings-stock-falls-after-hours" style="color:#4a6ee0; background:transparent; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt" target="_blank">consensus estimate of $1.77 billion</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The company revised its FY23 procedure volume outlook to 21%-22% (from 20%-22%), reflecting uncertainty around the duration of elevated procedure volumes with patients returning to health care, a continued slowing bariatric growth rates in the U.S. and macroeconomic challenges that could impact hospitals and patient spending.</p>

<p>Also, ISRG cut the gross margin outlook by 25bps at the midpoint to 68.0%-68.5% (vs. 68.0-69.0% previously) to reflect the timing of facilities completion, manufacturing efficiency improvements for new products and other complex projects and sees gross margin of = +70% over time in the medium term.</p>

<p><strong>RBC Capital Markets</strong>&nbsp;analyst&nbsp;<strong>Shagun Singh</strong>&nbsp;maintained the Outperform rating and a price target of $355.00.</p>

<p>The analyst estimates revenue of $7.09 billion (+14.1% y/y ex-fx) vs. consensus of $7.19 billion for FY23, including the assumed procedure volume growth of 21.5% y/y and systems shipped growth of 4.8% y/y.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Singh estimates EPS of $5.60 (+19.5% y/y), gross margin of 68.3% (-90bps y/y), and operating margin of 34.1% (-50bps y/y) for FY23.</p>

<p><strong>Piper Sandler</strong>&nbsp;analyst&nbsp;<strong>Adam C. Maeder</strong>&nbsp;reiterated the rating on the stock at Overweight and lowered the price target to $325 (from $385).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The analyst revised revenue and EPS estimates to $7,072.9 million (from $7,162.4 million) and $5.59 (from $5.58) for FY23 and $8,104.6 million (from $8,184.4 million) and $6.20 (from $6.43) for FY24.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Mizuho Securities</strong>&nbsp;analyst Anthony Petrone reaffirmed a Neutral rating and price target of $320.00.</p>

<p>The analyst lowered FY23 revenue and EPS estimates to $7.043 billion (from $7.103 billion) and $5.55 (from $5.45 earlier), reflecting a stable outlook for overall da Vinci procedures offset by a further slowdown in U.S. bariatrics and China capital placements.</p>

<p>The analyst writes that prevailing price levels will likely prove a floor through year-end as GLP-1/ China headwinds are further debated.</p>

<p><strong>William Blair&nbsp;</strong>analyst&nbsp;<strong>Brandon Vazquez</strong>&nbsp;maintained an Outperform rating.</p>

<p>The analyst sees several tailwinds to support double-digit sales and EPS growth in 2024, including continued uptake in U.S. general surgery, da Vinci SP adoption, Ion launch internationally, and potentially a next-gen multiport system.</p>

<p><strong>Raymond James</strong>&nbsp;analyst&nbsp;<strong>Jayson Bedford</strong>&nbsp;maintained an Outperform rating and lowered the price target to $310 from $368.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The analyst revised estimates for revenue and adjusted EPS to $7,062 million (from $7,127 million) and $5.60 (from $5.57) for FY23 and $7,887 million (from $8,141 million) and $6.22 (from $6.36) for FY24. This reflects higher leasing and slightly lower gross margins.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Price Action</strong>: ISRG shares are down 2.42% at $266.85 on the last check Friday.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>BMO Capital Markets&nbsp;</strong>analyst Jeffrey M. Silber reiterates the Market Perform rating on&nbsp;<strong>ManpowerGroup&nbsp;</strong>(NYSE:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MAN#NYSE">MAN</a>),&nbsp;<a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.benzinga.com/quote/MAN/analyst-ratings" style="background-image:initial; background-position:initial; background-size:initial; background-repeat:initial; background-attachment:initial; background-origin:initial; background-clip:initial; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; color:#4a6ee0" target="_blank">lowering the price target to $79 from $88.</a></p>

<p>The company reported third-quarter FY23 results where revenues from services declined 2.6% year-on-year to $4.676 billion,&nbsp;<a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.benzinga.com/calendars/earnings" style="background-image:initial; background-position:initial; background-size:initial; background-repeat:initial; background-attachment:initial; background-origin:initial; background-clip:initial; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; color:#4a6ee0" target="_blank">missing the analyst consensus of $4.70 billion.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Revenues fell 5%<a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/23/10/35331963/why-workforce-solutions-company-manpowergroups-shares-are-trading-lower-today" style="background-image:initial; background-position:initial; background-size:initial; background-repeat:initial; background-attachment:initial; background-origin:initial; background-clip:initial; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; color:#4a6ee0" target="_blank">&nbsp;at constant currency.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Geographically, Northern Europe was the largest miss compared to prior forecast, with other countries relatively in line on a CC basis, the analyst writes.</p>

<p>Management indicated further weakening through 3Q23 and some European Manpower brands weakening into 4Q23, though the analyst adds that some of this may have been baked-in given intra-quarter macro data.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Q3, the analyst said Northern Europe&#39;s performance was most negative vs. guide alongside negative margins, given exposure to bench model countries.</p>

<p>Silber adds that MAN&#39;s valuation historically has been negatively impacted by its European exposure. Given greater recessionary fears in Europe, the analyst notes that it&#39;s tough to recommend this name.</p>

<p>Management noted it will not shy away from decisive actions to preserve margin though using a &quot;fine-point pen vs. a broad brush,&quot; the analyst adds.</p>

<p>Given the uncertainties, the analyst lowers the FY23 revenue estimate to $18.851 billion from the previous estimate of $19.160 billion.</p>

<p>Silber projects FY23 EPS of $5.78,&nbsp;<a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.benzinga.com/calendars/guidance" style="background-image:initial; background-position:initial; background-size:initial; background-repeat:initial; background-attachment:initial; background-origin:initial; background-clip:initial; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; color:#4a6ee0" target="_blank">lower than the previous estimate of $5.92.</a></p>

<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Telsey Advisory Group</strong>&nbsp;analyst Joseph Feldman reiterates the Outperform rating on&nbsp;<strong>Tractor Supply Company</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSCO#NASDAQ">TSCO</a>),&nbsp;<a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.benzinga.com/quote/TSCO/analyst-ratings" style="background-image:initial; background-position:initial; background-size:initial; background-repeat:initial; background-attachment:initial; background-origin:initial; background-clip:initial; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; color:#4a6ee0" target="_blank">lowering the price target to $245 from $265.</a></p>

<p>Tractor Supply will report 3Q23 earnings on&nbsp;<a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.benzinga.com/calendars/earnings" style="background-image:initial; background-position:initial; background-size:initial; background-repeat:initial; background-attachment:initial; background-origin:initial; background-clip:initial; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; color:#4a6ee0" target="_blank">Thursday, October 26.</a></p>

<p>The analyst expects total sales growth of 7.0% to $3.5 billion, on a lower comp of 1.0% vs. 2.5% previously. Feldman revises&nbsp;<a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.benzinga.com/calendars/earnings" style="background-image:initial; background-position:initial; background-size:initial; background-repeat:initial; background-attachment:initial; background-origin:initial; background-clip:initial; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; color:#4a6ee0" target="_blank">3Q23 EPS estimate to $2.30 from $2.32.</a></p>

<p>Feldman&#39;s moderated sales forecast reflects Tractor Supply lapping difficult comparisons from the past three years fueled by heightened spending as a result of the pandemic and government stimulus&mdash;comps of 27%, 13%, and 6% in 3Q20, 3Q21, and 3Q22, respectively.</p>

<p>The analyst also sees slowing inflation weighing on average ticket, as the average monthly growth in the CPI fell to 3.5% in 3Q23 from 4.0% in 2Q23 and 8.3% in 3Q22.</p>

<p>The analyst also forecasts softening macro demand indicators&mdash;U.S. government industry retail sales were down 4.4% YoY in 3Q23, and the agricultural customer base is weaker, with corn prices and farmer incomes both down significantly.</p>

<p>Feldman projects inline&nbsp;<a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.benzinga.com/calendars/guidance" style="background-image:initial; background-position:initial; background-size:initial; background-repeat:initial; background-attachment:initial; background-origin:initial; background-clip:initial; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; color:#4a6ee0" target="_blank">gross margin expansion of 55 bps to 36.2%,&nbsp;</a>reflecting lower freight costs and benefits from strategic initiatives, partially offset by inflation and an unfavorable product mix shift toward C.U.E (consumable, usable and edible).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Given ongoing wage pressure and strategic investments, the analyst estimates roughly inline SG&amp;A ratio deleverage of ~10 bps to 26.4%.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The analyst projects an operating margin expansion of 38 bps to 9.7%.&nbsp;Given the unfavorable macro trends, the analyst lowers the 2024 EPS estimate to $11.05, down from $11.42.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>The <strong>New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory Commission</strong> (NJ-CRC) recently made significant strides in the state&#39;s <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/cannabis">cannabis industry</a> by granting approvals for numerous licenses.</p>

<h3>New Jersey Approves 112 Adult-Use Cannabis Licenses, Expanding Market Activity</h3>

<p>The NJ-CRC approved a total of 112 adult-use cannabis licenses, comprising 40 conditional licenses, 52 conversions to annual licenses, and 20 annual license applications, as reported by <a href="https://headynj.com/nj-crc-approves-112-nj-adult-use-cannabis-licenses-reviews-terrascend-problems-again/">HEADYNJ</a>.</p>

<p>NJ-CRC executive director <strong>Jeff Brown</strong> noted that although the commission currently has numerous applications in inactive status due to businesses not responding to the its staff, there is growing activity in the New Jersey adult-use and medical cannabis market, with 60 dispensaries now operational.</p>

<p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/topic/new-jersey-cannabis">New Jersey</a> is witnessing the emergence of adult-use-only cultivators and manufacturing cannabis, diversifying production within the market.</p>

<p><strong>TerrAscend Corp.</strong> (OTCQX:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSNDF#OTCQX">TSNDF</a>) New Jersey&nbsp;recently violated medical cannabis rules said Brown. The company submitted a corrective action plan, but a subsequent violation occurred.</p>

However, the NJ-CRC decided not to recommend a fine in this instance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our goal here is compliance. Since that initial round of activity, they&rsquo;ve largely been compliant,&rdquo; Brown concluded.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>As this year&#8217;s cannabis harvest season gets underway, competition for seasonal workers intensifies, reflecting broader economic challenges and shifts in the marijuana industry.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Layoffs And Labor Needs</h2>



<p><strong>Kate Robertson </strong>of MJBizDaily <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/demand-for-seasonal-cannabis-harvest-workers-surges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a> that due to recent <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/01/30337184/cannabis-industrys-workforce-trimming-trend-continues-columbia-care-announces-dozens-of-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">widespread layoffs</a>, many cultivators are now hiring temporary workers for the harvest.</p>



<p>The industry has experienced an unprecedented 2% drop in marijuana job numbers since early 2022, a first since states commenced the legalization of cannabis. This decrease, as reported by Denver&#8217;s Vangst, explains why marijuana cultivation <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/02/30896835/sndl-joins-tilray-canopy-and-curaleaf-in-force-reductions-layoffs-85-employees-at-olds-alberta-f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">companies</a> are scrambling for temp workers for the impending fall harvest.</p>



<p><strong>Kara Bradford</strong>, CEO of Viridian Staffing, a Seattle-based cannabis recruitment firm, told MJBizDaily, "There have been a lot of layoffs over the past 18 months." She added, "So they're running slimmer crews and need that additional assistance because of harvest season."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Competition for Seasonal Workers</h2>



<p><strong>Jacob Carlson</strong> of Boston&#8217;s EzHire Cannabis, pointed to the industry&#8217;s challenges, indicating that many companies "weren't able to actually build out a real cultivation team with full-time salaries or benefits." The demand for these temporary positions, however, conflicts with mainstream industries similarly seeking temporary workers, urged by similar macroeconomic pressures.</p>



<p>Adding to the complexity, cannabis harvest work, described as &#8220;more grueling than temporary retail jobs&#8221; by Carlson, often sees higher turnover. State-required background and criminal-record checks also create additional hurdles for growers hoping to hire a temporary cannabis workforce.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Financial Strains In A Maturing Market</h2>



<p>Yet, not all see the increased demand as a sign of distress. Vangst&#8217;s CEO, <strong>Karson Humiston</strong> interprets it as a signal of market maturity. "Companies have gotten better at projecting their labor needs given that the industry is continuing to mature," Humiston remarked to MJBizDaily.</p>



<p>Contrary to growers&#8217; expectations of temp workers being more affordable than full-time employees, Bradford said costs such as workers&#8217; compensation, unemployment insurance and training can accumulate. "It's an increase in demand, more need, but less funds to do so with," she said.</p>



<p>Large multistate operators with greater financial resources are often positioned more favorably, capable of offering competitive wages to attract seasonal workers. Conversely, smaller companies, constrained by budgetary limitations, grapple to keep pace.</p>



<p>To optimize hiring processes, experts advise cultivators to initiate recruitment efforts early.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>David Beckham</strong> has reemerged in the headlines after <strong>Netflix Inc </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class="ticker" href="https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NFLX#NASDAQ">NFLX</a>) released a <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/entertainment/23/10/35203931/beckham-scores-for-netflix-kelce-for-amazon-messi-up-next-for-apple-sports-documentaries-hi" style="text-decoration-line:none">new documentary series</a> about Beckham and his wife, <strong>Victoria Beckham</strong>. Beckham was once one of the world&rsquo;s best soccer players, leading teams like Manchester United, <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/topic/soccer">Real Madrid and more.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Beckham&rsquo;s Business Brain: </strong>The sports world was shocked in 2007 when Beckham left Real Madrid, one of the premier teams in Europe, to join the LA Galaxy of MLS. At the time, the MLS was still very small compared to other soccer leagues around the world, so many thought it was questionable for Beckham to play in the MLS while he was still in his athletic prime.</p>

<p>But this is where Beckham&rsquo;s business savviness came into play. When Beckham joined the LA Galaxy, the MLS was only 10 years old. His contract came with an option to buy an expansion franchise for $25 million. Beckham retired in 2013 and exercised his option the following year, establishing Inter Miami.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Andrew Petcash</strong>, the founder of Profluence Sports, outlined Beckham&rsquo;s incredible story in a <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewPetcash/status/1557758420421382144?s=20" style="text-decoration-line:none">thread on X.com.</a> Petcash has grown a substantial following on X.com by making interesting threads related to athletes&#39; finances. He founded Profluence as a platform dedicated to aggregating insights, content and data about the future of sports and money.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, Inter Miami is worth more than $500 million and has one of the best players in the world, <strong>Lionel Messi</strong>, on its roster. The MLS has experienced dramatic growth in the United States&nbsp;since Beckham came in 2007, in part because he paved the way for other major soccer stars like Messi to come to the MLS.</p>

<h1>Analyst Ratings: What Are They?</h1>
<p>Benzinga tracks 150 analyst firms and reports on their stock expectations. Analysts typically arrive at their conclusions by predicting how much money a company will make in the future, usually the upcoming five years, and how risky or predictable that company's revenue streams are.</p>
<p>Analysts attend company conference calls and meetings, research company financial statements, and communicate with insiders to publish their ratings on stocks. Analysts typically rate each stock once per quarter or whenever the company has a major update.</p>
<p>Some analysts also offer predictions for helpful metrics such as earnings, revenue, and growth estimates to provide further guidance as to what to do with certain tickers. It is important to keep in mind that while stock and sector analysts are specialists, they are also human and can only forecast their beliefs to traders.</p>

<h1>How Are Analyst Ratings Determined?</h1>
<p>Ratings come from analysts, or specialists within banking and financial systems that report for specific stocks or defined sectors (typically once per quarter for each stock). Analysts usually derive their information from company conference calls and meetings, financial statements, and conversations with important insiders to reach their decisions.</p>
<p>Some analysts publish their predictions for metrics such as growth estimates, earnings, and revenue to provide additional guidance with their ratings. When using analyst ratings, it is important to keep in mind that stock and sector analysts are also human and are only offering their opinions to investors.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>The link between <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/cannabis">cannabis</a> and creativity is explored in the recently released short documentary, <strong>&quot;Cannabis + Creativity.&quot;</strong> Featuring <strong>Sam Jones, Miyabe Shields, Treya Lam, Chef Ali, Kaya Nicole and Jasmine Mans,</strong> the film was executively produced by <strong>Etain</strong> and <strong>Dr. Nancy B. Austin.</strong> <strong>Elana Frankel,</strong> the director and producer, joined hands with <strong>Kassia Graham</strong> in the project, produced in partnership with <strong>Cabin Creek Films.</strong></p>

<p>Director Elana Frankel shared the essence of the documentary, stating, &quot;Can cannabis increase creativity? We set out to discover some answers in our documentary &#39;Cannabis + Creativity.&#39; We follow the creative process of six people from various backgrounds and professions to find out how the plant supports their lifestyle. They experiment, take risks, break rules and have fun, but in the end, they all use cannabis as a tool to express themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Diving into the personal and professional lives of these six artists, the documentary showcases intimate interviews and reveals their unique creative processes, demonstrating the significant impact cannabis has on their artistic expression. The film&#39;s subjects range from composers and musicians to poets and designers, each underscoring the plant&#39;s vital role in their artistic endeavors.</p>

<p>Adding depth to the narrative, a skeptical grandmother is introduced, symbolizing the generational divide on cannabis use. Her reservations offer an engaging contrast to the ardent creators, stimulating a comprehensive discussion about cannabis&#39;s position in contemporary art and innovation.</p>

<p>Etain, the first and only&nbsp;women-founded medical cannabis dispensary in New York, is a prominent backer of the film. <strong>Jes Feuer,</strong> the marketing director at Etain, commented on the company&#39;s involvement.&nbsp;&quot;Etain is honored to support the making of the Cannabis + Creativity short documentary... We are so proud to support the team who created the film to highlight many of the women who share their stories of how cannabis not only has helped them heal and manage their day-to-day life, but also has given them meaning and powers them through their own creative endeavors.&quot;</p>

<p>The film invites viewers to a comprehensive insight into the crossroads of cannabis consumption and artistic innovation. Cannabis + Creativity is scheduled for screening as an official selection at the Catskill International Film Festival on Sunday, October 22nd.</p>]]></description>

<h3>Toward A Tight DMT Company</h3>

<p>This August 28, Small Pharma and Cybin <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/08/34074153/cybins-acquisition-of-small-pharma-will-elevate-dmt-therapeutics-for-depression-and-anxiety">entered into</a> a definitive arrangement&nbsp;for Cybin&rsquo;s acquisition of all Small Pharma&rsquo;s issued and outstanding securities in an all-share transaction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On October 12, shareholders of both companies <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/10/35245376/cybin-and-small-pharma-shareholders-green-light-acquisition-resolution-results-expected-dates">voted in favor</a> of the plan. On October 17, Small Pharma obtained a <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/23/10/35315422/moving-closer-to-cybin-acquisition-small-pharma-obtains-final-order-approving-arrangement">final approval order</a> from the BC Supreme Court which, together with satisfaction or waiver of other closing conditions, would enable the arrangement to close on or about Oct. 23, 2023.</p>

<p>Small Pharma&rsquo;s pipeline consists of short-duration psychedelic therapies targeting mental health conditions, most noticeably clinical-staged DMT-based assets SPL026 and SPL028.</p>

<p><strong>CEO George Tziras</strong> says Small Pharma has made &ldquo;exceptional progress&rdquo; over the past eight years and that the team is thrilled to enter &ldquo;the next stage of the company&rsquo;s evolution&rdquo; by combining its efforts and journey with Cybin.</p>

<p>The new combined company will be <strong>led by Cybin&rsquo;s CEO&nbsp;Doug Drysdale,</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;while Tziras will join the board of directors.&nbsp;</p>
